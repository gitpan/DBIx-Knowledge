DBIx::Knowledge - Report creation on linear convergent data sets for Business Intelligence

DBIx::Knowledge gives analysts and non-engineers the ability to create reports and drill-down into
an aggregated data set (database table or view). Furthermore, the available fields and data points to choose
from can be configured without writing any code.
